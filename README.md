mandelbrotG5
============

A pure Python script for creating arbitrarily hi resolution images of the Mandelbrot set

This code was born out of helping an old friend with some CS homework in 2012,
and it is named for the machine I primarily used while working on it, my beautiful PowerMac G5 Quad (R.I.P.)

The main dependancy ATM is pypng, which you can find with google. The test script also depends on Numpy and maybe Matplotlib.
