mandelbrotG5
============

A pure Python script for creating arbitrarily hi resolution images of the Mandelbrot set

This code was born out of helping my now ex-girlfriend with some CS homework a year ago,
and it is named for the machine I primarily used for writing it on, my beautiful PowerMac
G5 Quad.
