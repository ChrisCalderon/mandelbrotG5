mandelbrotG5
============

A pure Python script for creating arbitrarily hi resolution images of the Mandelbrot set. It works by creating rows of escape time values, and writing those values to files. The main process then turns the values into rgb colors and makes a .png image.

The code has one dependency, pypng, and was born out of helping an old friend with some CS homework in 2012,

This project is dedicated to my beautiful PowerMac G5 Quad (R.I.P.)
